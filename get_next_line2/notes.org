information, the link element is a link to the next node.

the first link is known as the HEAD. the last node is known to be last as the

* get_next_line.c

what needs to be done:

1. allocate memory the size of BUFFER_SIZE to read into.
2. read allocated memory.
3. search for a newline character
   a. if you do not find one, back to 1. (but from the new starting point?)
   b. if you do find one,


1. allocate a memory buffer with size BUFFER_SIZE.
2. read the file into this memory.
3. if you do not
