#+title: push_swap notes

* task:
you have two stacks, named ~a~ and ~b~. ~a~ is: unsorted, contains a random
number of positive and negative ints, and contains no duplicates. ~b~ is empty.

* stacks
as either an array or a linked list, a stack is a structure of

* legal moves
Sort into ascending order all numbers into stack ~a~. following operations are
at your disposal:

** sa (swap a)
swap first two elements at the top of stack a
#+begin_quote
STACK A
1 \ > 2
2 / > 1
3     3
4     4
#+end_quote

if a is empty, do nothing.
** sb (swap b)
swap first two elements at the top of stack b
#+begin_quote
STACK B
1 \ > 2
2 / > 1
3     3
4     4
#+end_quote

if a is empty, do nothing.

** ss (swap a & b)
do sa and sb

** pa (push a)
take first element at th top of b and put it at the top of a
** pb (push b)
take first element at th top of a and put it at the top of b
** ra (rotate a)
shift all elements of a by 1 (first becomes last.)
#+begin_quote
STACK A
1 /   2
2 /   3
3 /   4
4 /   1
#+end_quote

** rb (rotate b)
shift all elements of b up by 1 (first becomes last.)
#+begin_quote
STACK B
1 /   2
2 /   3
3 /   4
4 /   1
#+end_quote
** rr (rotate both)
rotate a and b at the same time.

** rra (reverse rotate a)
shift all elements of a down 1 (last becomes first.)
#+begin_quote
STACK A
1 \   4
2 \   1
3 \   2
4 \   3
#+end_quote

** rrb (reverse rotate b)
shift all elements of b down 1 (last becomes first.)
#+begin_quote
STACK B
1 \   4
2 \   1
3 \   2
4 \   3
#+end_quote

** rrr (rra & rrb)
